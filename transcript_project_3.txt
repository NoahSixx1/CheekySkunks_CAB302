hello hello 2

Feedback: This is a very short and simplistic verse. The artist may be trying to create a catchy hook, but without more content or depth, it's hard to assess the overall quality of the lyrics. More complex rhyme schemes, metaphors, and storytelling would elevate this verse.

Feedback: This verse seems to lack any meaningful content or artistic expression. The repetition of "hello" is not particularly clever or impactful, and there's no clear message or emotion conveyed through the lyrics.
