  i like dogs
  i live in the fog


Feedback: The lyrics are brief and lack a clear message or theme, resulting in a low score. They appear to be a disconnected list of statements rather than a cohesive rap verse. The use of "yo" as an opening phrase is somewhat generic and doesn't add much depth to the lyrics.
