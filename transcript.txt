  hey
  listen
  yeah i came from the dirt
  now i'm listing gold
  every rhyme that i spit
  got a story told
  used to dream in a dark
  now i'm little i don't
  never follow the crowd
  i just pull it up
  mike in my hand like a sword on see everybody a job mesa dow retreat
  i'm here for of fame
  or a fake applause
  i'm a break every chain
  i'm a bender loss
