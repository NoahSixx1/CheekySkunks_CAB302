the third bobo

Feedback: The lyrics seem to be a reference to the French concept of "bobo" which refers to an affluent, urbanite with bourgeois tastes. However, with only three words ("the third bobo") it's unclear what message or theme is being conveyed. Additional context or information would be needed for a more meaningful analysis.
